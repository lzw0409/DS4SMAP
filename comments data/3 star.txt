I have spent about 25 hours of self study to realise I do not have any evidence of participation in this course. It makes it difficult to show this on my portfolio. Share  ' Share Review by Amir S. on 11 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0MMalik W.Verified learner3.0 star rating09/05/20Covid 19Review by Malik W. on 9 May 2020review stating Covid 19Excellent and good to improve information about Coronavirus Share  ' Share Review by Malik W. on 9 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0DDheeraj K.Verified learner3.0 star rating09/05/20AverageReview by Dheeraj K. on 9 May 2020review stating AverageAverage Share  ' Share Review by Dheeraj K. on 9 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0Anil J.Verified learner3.0 star rating07/05/20Nice courseReview by Anil J. on 7 May 2020review stating Nice courseNice course Share  ' Share Review by Anil J. on 7 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0SSASHMA C.Verified learner3.0 star rating05/05/20COVID-19 Critical Care: Understanding and Application.Review by SASHMA C. on 5 May 2020review stating COVID-19 Critical Care: Understanding and Application.GOOD Share  ' Share Review by SASHMA C. on 5 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0DDr K.Verified learner3.0 star rating02/05/20okReview by Dr K. on 2 May 2020review stating oki would give 3.5, it was informative . but there was nothing on medications and those related to drugs and dosing etc. there is no certificate available too Share  ' Share Review by Dr K. on 2 May 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0SShankar M.Verified learner3.0 star rating29/04/20Covid 19 a important viewReview by Shankar M. on 29 Apr 2020review stating Covid 19 a important viewCovid -19 is spoiled many publics life, because of this virus, have to get remedy as possible as earlier Share  ' Share Review by Shankar M. on 29 Apr 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0AAli H.Verified learner3.0 star rating27/04/20ThanksReview by Ali H. on 27 Apr 2020review stating ThanksThank you for this information Share  ' Share Review by Ali H. on 27 Apr 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0Subhadeep S.Verified learner3.0 star rating26/04/20Few changes need to done.Review by Subhadeep S. on 26 Apr 2020review stating Few changes need to done.The course needs more organization of Topics. Though all the topics are covered what I feel is that the course needs a proper binding. Some topics are very much elongated making the student get bored of the learning process, tough each section are important and well described.Lastly some videos should be cut short focusing the main areas. Share  ' Share Review by Subhadeep S. on 26 Apr 2020Was this review helpful?  0  0
